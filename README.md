# secure-time-sync
Obtains network time in secure manner - ideally put inside cron so it runs periodically.  
Most of work was done by [Madaidan](https://github.com/madaidan), with some fixes of my own.  
Script has not been maintained in some time, but is easy to use and thus I decided to upload it here.  
Superceeded by [sdwdate](https://github.com/Kicksecure/sdwdate) in every way.
